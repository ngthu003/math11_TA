# Math 11 - Resources

This repository is a collection of course notes and discussion notes for Math 11 - Calculus-based Introduction to Probability and Statistics at UCSD, which I have prepared while TA-ing during Winter '20 and Spring '20.

This course is especially designed for students who majoring in biology-related majors, such as biology, general biology, public health majors, etc, students who will go on to medical school. As such, different from other more traditional probability and statistics classes, I have been trying hard to convey the concepts into "more accessible" language (ie. without using math jargons, such as

> instead of "the probability of A conditioned on B", it is now "let's say B has happened, think about how it influences the chance of A happening"

> instead of "the probability of the complement of A or B", it is now, "let's say we do not want A to happen, and also B to not happen, what is the probability of that?")

In order to better illustrate concepts, I have had to think of relatable examples, such as

> San Diego and California in general are known to have some of the best weather in the country. Say I want to go to the beach tomorrow, what is the chance that I will have to cancel the plan because of rain?

> Have you ever wondered how long a green light at a crossing on 1st street in downtown San Diego is?

As such, it has been a fun journey having to juggle between the world of abstract math and the world of everyday life and finding the connections.

The main topics we cover are:

1. __[Descriptive statistics](https://github.com/thn003/math11_TA/blob/master/Math%2011%20-%20Discussion%201.pdf)__

Additionally, this is the __[course notes](https://github.com/thn003/math11_TA/blob/master/Math%2011%20-%20Course%20Notes.pdf)__
summarizing the key concepts, their inter-relation, and some illustrations and remarks on the topics where applicable.
